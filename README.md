Guidelines:
    - Fork the GIT rep
    - Build out the designed form that's in /design/form-challenge.png
    - Allowed libraries/plugins:
        - Modernizr
        - jQuery
        - jQuery Validation (or any JS validation plugin)
    - Make sure you're not loading in resources you don't need
    - Use HTML 5 validation that fallsback to JS validation, which falls back to PHP validation (you don't have to build the PHP validation)
    - Make sure the form is naturally keyboard accessible
    - Use semantic HTML
